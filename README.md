# UX
## Project Goals


## External user's goal
- Buy jewelry, when available, from Rock Drops

## Site owner goal
- Show Inventory, and create limited time jewelry sales  


## User Stories

As a user I would to...
- Add item(s) I am interested in into a basket so I can purchase them once I have completed my shopping
- have a user account so I can see my past orders, and save my delivery details
- to see products by product type so I filter for what i am looking for
- to be able to see all products which might be available in the future so I can plan what I am going to buy in the future
- search for a specific product so I do not have to look at all products if i am searching for something specific
- to get confirmation emails so I know my order was successful and have a copy of all order information
- be able to check out without having a register account so I can make a one time purchase
- have a quick add button so I can add an item to my basket without having to leave the all products page 

As a site owner I would like to...
- be able to add products to my inventory so users can view them
- be able to plan product drops in advance so I can make them live at all at once
- be able to edit product details of existing products so I can keep things up to date
- be able to delete products so I can reduce the number of useless data available to users
